# SonicEye-Proximity-and-Obstacle-Detection

Coded by Kevin Ge and Rohan Narayan
This code is uploaded to the Arduino to run the device.

The Arduino UNO is connected to 2 speakers, and 5 ultrasonic HC SR04 sensors.
The pin connections are specified in the program comments.

This device will scan constantly for large obstacles within a 180 degree field of view. Depending on the direction and distance of the obstacle, the arduino will output different pitched and frequency of sounds to warn a user of an obstacle.
